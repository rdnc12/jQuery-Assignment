## jQuery-Assignment

**_Deadline Wednesday evening_**


The tasks are all about Javascript and jQuery exercise. It is going to be very beneficial for you. Try to gain the most from it..

### Description

1. First of all fork this repository. After forking you should see this repo in your own GitHub account. 

2. Now you have the repo in your GitHub. Clone the repo. Now you can work locally.

3. The project contains `index.html`,  `style.css` and `app.js`. The css and js files are already connected to the html file. So you may start writing js code right away. If you preview the html, you will see no functioning web-page. Your task is to make them functioning.

#### Here are the tasks to do

- `Delete` buttons should remove the topics (`li` elements). 
- `Add` button should add a topic (an `li` element inside 2 `span` elements).
- There is a `checkbox` under the topics. It should hide all topics when checked, unhide when unchecked. (hide all `ul` elements)
- There is search field above. It should filter the topics (filter `li` elements). It should be case-insensitive.
- After finishing the tasks; do `add` `commit` and `push` to update the repository on your GitHub account, and share the link of the repo via Trello.
