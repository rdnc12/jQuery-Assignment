#### Here are the tasks to do, you must use jQuery to solve them

- `Delete` buttons should remove the topics (`li` elements). 
- `Add` button should add a topic (an `li` element inside 2 `span` elements).
- There is a `checkbox` under the topics. It should hide all topics when checked, unhide when unchecked. (hide all `ul` elements)
- There is search field above. It should filter the topics (filter `li` elements). It should be case-insensitive.
- After finishing the tasks; do `add` `commit` and `push` to update the repository on your GitHub account, and share the link of the project like [this](https://livecodingonline.github.io/jQuery-Assignment/) via Trello. *Remember: Repository settings > GitHub Pages > Source (master)*

###### Bonus
- You may add your own styles and possibly add more items and functionalities to the project. You may use this project for your portfolio. Even it could be shared via LinkedIn rightaway.
